# Object-Oriented Programming in Kotlin

Learning about **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

OOP is a **programming paradigm** that became popular in the 1970s and 80s. OOP allows complex systems to be broken down and is based around the concept of **objects**.

The popularity of OOP in the 1980s was connected with the rise of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) on personal computers of that era.

## Objects

OOP objects are self-contained are contain both data and code. The data defines the object's **state** and the code defines its **behaviour**.

- The **data** items stored in an object are called **fields** (but you might sometimes see them called *attributes* or *properties*)
- The **code** functions stored in an object are called **methods** (or sometimes *procedures*)

## Classes

Objects are created, or **instantiated** from a **class**. The class acts as a **blueprint** for the objects, defining the fields and methods that each object will have.

When an object is instantiated from a class, we say that we have created an **instance** of that class.
